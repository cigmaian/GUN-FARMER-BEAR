# Project: Rock Paper Scissors

This is my first HTML/CSS/JS project. Live version of the game is __[here](https://cigmaian.github.io/GUN-FARMER-BEAR/)__.

## First stage, Make the game work in the browser console:

What I have learned:

- Deepened knowledge of how functions work with each other.
- Learned how to color the console text.

## Second stage, game with added UI

What I have learned:

-  Learned to use and modify emoji.
-  Learned basic manipulations of elements styles through JavaScript code (setting attributes, adding/removing classes, changing inline styles and texts).
-  Improved my understanding of JavaScript functions (organization, workspaces, scopes, calling, invoking, breaking down into smaller ones..).


## Conclusion

- The game is fully playable in the browser window.
- I really tried to keep readable and understandable code, short functions and descriptive names.
